OOPs is a object oriented programming languageObject-oriented programming â€“ As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.
The main features of OOPs are:
    Class
    Objects
    Encapsulation
    Abstraction
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance
    Dynamic Binding
    Message Passing.
    
   End.
   
Object:

Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example: chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike etc. It can be physical and logical.

Class:

Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

Inheritance:

When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent object i.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.   


Polymorphism:

When one task is performed by different ways i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.

In C++, we use Function overloading and Function overriding to achieve polymorphism.

Abstraction:

Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

In C++, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

Encapsulation:

Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. For example: capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
